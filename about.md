<p>
	I'm Rosie, an aspiring web and software developer based in Sydney Australia. That is, I code websites and apps and aim to make them look fantastic, functional and usable across all platforms of media. I enjoy front-end development although my ultimate goal in my career is to be a full stack developer and/or be a project manager.  I also have a strong interest in UI/UX development.
</p>

<p> 
	I am also a SPROUT at UTS where my role is to encourage prospecting students to apply at UTS and to pursue STEM subjects in school. I have spent the last two years at UTS, studying a bit of engineering and software development, and before that, I have begun my coding journey through TAFE. I am also an active member of the Women in Engineering and IT group where my goals are to encourage and uplift women in the STEM industry and to learn from one another. I often attend meetups in Sydney in the spare time that I can find, some meetups that you could find me at are SydJS, NgSydney, codelikeagirl and NodeGirls. 
</p>

<p> 
	In my spare time I play online video games, go hiking or cook with my family. I enjoy long, romatic walks to the fridge and listening to music. If I had friends who had to describe me in three short words it would be: kind, happy and smart. Projects listed below are still 'in progress', that is, I am still iterating and they are in development.
