<p>
	I'm Rosie, an aspiring web and software developer based in Sydney Australia. That is, I code websites and apps and aim to make them look fantastic, functional and usable across all platforms of media. I currently work as a junior developer at Digiground for about five months, where my role is to develop hybrid apps for existing clients and manage our codebase. I enjoy coding hybrid apps because it is a straightforward and fast way to make mobile apps to work on both significant mobile platforms.

<p> 
	I am also a SPROUT at UTS where my role is to encourage prospecting students to apply at UTS and to pursue STEM subjects in school. I have spent the last two years at UTS, studying a bit of engineering and software development, and before that, I have begun my coding journey through TAFE. I am also an active member of the Women in Engineering and IT group where my goals are to encourage and uplift women in the STEM industry and to learn from one another. I often attend meetups in Sydney in the spare time that I can find, some meetups that you could find me at are SydJS, NgSydney, codelikeagirl and NodeGirls.

	In my spare time I play online video games, go hiking or cook with my family. I enjoy long, romatic walks to the fridge and listening to music. If I had friends who had to describe me in three short words it would be: kind, happy and smart.
