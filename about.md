<p>
	I'm Rosie, an aspiring web and software developer based in Sydney Australia. That is, I code websites and apps and aim to make them look fantastic, functional and usable across all platforms of media. I enjoy front-end development although my ultimate goal in my career is to be a full stack developer and/or be a project manager.  I also have a strong interest in UI/UX design.
</p>

<p> 
	My passion for education and technology erised from becoming a fellow SPROUT at UTS where my role is to encourage prospecting students to apply at UTS and to pursue STEM subjects in school. I have spent the last two years at UTS, studying a bit of engineering and software development, and before that, I have begun my coding journey through TAFE. I am also an active member of the Women in Engineering and IT group where my goals are to encourage and uplift women in the STEM industry.

	At this present day, I am currently working on a range of data visualisation projects for big data research. Through the various Mixed Reality modes that we are able to experience immersive interactions, I develop a way of which we are able to visualise big data and analyse it in many different ways. Some research areas that I've been working on are Blockchain data and Weather data.

<p> 
	In my spare time I play online video games, go hiking or cook with my family. I enjoy long, romatic walks to the fridge and listening to music. If I had friends who had to describe me in three short words it would be: kind, happy and smart. Projects listed below are still 'in progress', that is, I am still iterating and they are in development.
