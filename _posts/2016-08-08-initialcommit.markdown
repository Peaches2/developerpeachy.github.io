Hello everyone! this is my very first commit to GitHub! This is my very first time using Jekyll and it has been very simple to set up. Will post some helpful instructions soon on my future posts. Please check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk] and check out my [GitHub][PeachysGithub].
